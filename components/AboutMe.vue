        Hi! I am <b>Bálint Hegedüs</b>, a chemical engineer in paper, a software developer at heart and
        a full-stack web application developer as described in my current job title. You can read about my
        journey on how did I get from learning chemical engineering to becoming a full-stack developer.

        At 2013 I was faced with a huge decision. Do I want to follow my dreams in chemistry,
        or in information technology. At that time I deciede to cast my vote with chemistry,
        and thus started studying chemical engineering at the Budapest University of technology
        and Economics. While I enjoyed my time there, I cold not stop the calling of software
        development, so at my final semester I took up a course in programming.

        During this time, as I had to decide on my master's, I again started thinking about changing my
        current field to something more related to IT, but due to personal reasons, I could not make
        that leap. But that does not deter me from chasing my dreams, I started to search for
        internship in an IT company. That is how I started working at SAP as an `Application Support
        Intern`. While this took me a step closer to my dreams, but I also came to realise, that
        I do not want to interact with software, I want to make one.

        To achieve my goals, I started to focus on my strengths as a checmical engineer, who loves
        to tinker around with code, and that is how I found my way to the world of PLCs and industrial
        autmation. As a chemical engineer I had domain knowledge (in the checmical industry), but
        I also possessed the ability to write code. Because of this, I started working for a small firm,
        who was a contractor for Egis Pharmaceutical Company. Here, I had the opportunity to plan, and
        develop software, which controlled the water purification and distribution process for a newly
        built plant. Also I wrote my master thesis at this company about indastrial automation and ISA-S88
        standard.

        But my luck turned again and after finishing my master studies in June of 2019, it turned out, the firm
        I worked for unfortunately could not provide a full-time job for me. Because of this, I started looking for
        a job (related to industrial automation), and that is how I found my place at Evosoft Hungary as a
        Test Automation Engineer. I decided to accept this role, as I believed, that I will have the opportunity
        to gain deeper knowledge with PLCs (as my team was testing the Siemens TIA portal). This turned out to
        be true, but I also learned (once again) a more valuable lesson. That I do not want to use software but to
        make one. This is why my career here lasted not even a year, and I left in March of 2020.

        Because of my disinterest in beeing a full-time test engineer, I started to help out my friends with a project at
        the autumn of 2019. This project was so successful for us, that we were able to switch from having this as
        a side project for us to becoming our full-time work! A continue to work for them as a contractor, and since
        the start of 2021 not just as a developer, but as the technical lead for the project.
